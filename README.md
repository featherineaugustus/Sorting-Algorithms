# Sorting-Algorithms

Different sorting algorithms implemented in Python3

List of sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble sort
  - Across the range 0 to (n-1-1) check the values of i vs i+1
  - if arr[i] > arr[i+1], swap i and i+1 position such that the larger number is behind
  - Repeat for arr[0:n-2] until arr[0:0]

2. Insertion sort
  - Search and locate the index of the smallest number in arr[0:(n-1)]
  - Place the smallest number at the start of the array
  - Repeat search for arr[1:(n-1)] until arr[(n-1):(n-1)]
